						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Strain moved to the Associations Tool</span>: The background Strain association with Mouseline which was previously on the Edit Mouseline was moved to the tool icon at the top right of the blue menu. From this new "Mouseline - Background Strain" association menu, you can create strains, delete strains, archive strains and associate strains with mouselines. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Colony owner names added to the list pages</span>: On every list, you can now see the name of the owner whose colony you are viewing, making it easier for group accounts to quickly identify the colony they are in without opening the Filter or looking at the owner column.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">New Mating page Mouseline drop down auto-select</span>: When selecting male and female breeders on the New Mating page, if they have the same Mouseline, then the Litter Mouseline will be selected automatically, saving you a click!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Strain auto-select when only one Strain associated with the line</span>: If a Mouseline only has one associated Strain, then this Strain will be selected automatically when the Mouseline is selected for a Mouse (e.g. on the New Mouse page or Edit Mouse page).</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Strain added to Cage List Filter</span>: You can now filter your Cage List by the new Strain filter parameter on the Cage List.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse Comment added to the Cage List Filter</span>: You can now filter your Cage List by mouse comments in the new Mouse Comment filter parameter on the Cage List.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Plate ID added to Mouse List Filter</span>: You can now filter your Mouse List by the Plate ID column.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouseline List hyperlinks to records</span>: We added short cuts to the #Mice, #Mating, #Litter, #Cage columns on the Mouseline List so that you can quickly hyperlink to any list (Mouse, Mating, Litter, Cage) prefiltered by the desired mouseline, so you don't need to go through the Filter.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Alt IDs. autofill from a specified value</span>: We upgraded the Alt ID. AutoFill button on the Edit Pups window on the Edit Litter page so that you can autofill your Alt IDs mid list (previously the Autofill would always start from the top of the Alt. ID list.) </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Plate IDs can be appended like Comments</span>: When editing a mouse that already has a plate ID inputted, if you want to add additional content on the Edit Mouse page, you now have the option to append to or replace the existing Plate ID content (similar to how the Comment works).</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Coat Color added to the Family tree hover</span>: On the Family Tree, when you hover your cursor over a mouse icon on the screen, you can now see the Coat Color of that mouse (if one exists!) </li>

						</ol>				
						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Calendar Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Custom event description added to the calendar sync email</span>: In the email notification that gets sent when a new event is created, the event's description will show up in the email, in addition to the event name.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Event creator no longer changes on edit</span>: We fixed an issue that was previously causing event creator's to be changed to the event editor. The creator of an event is now static. </li>
						</ol>
						
						<span class="bold darkredfont">Defect Fixes</span>:
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Archived lines no longer showing on mouse list</span>: We fixed an issue that was preventing archived lines from being removed from the screen after editing mouseline. Archived lines now stay in the archive as they should! </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Current Litter Filter on Mating List</span>: The issue that was preventing the Mating List filter from pulling up all mating records that currently don't have a litter is fixed. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Number Filter on Mating List</span>: The issue that was preventing the Mating List filter from displaying matings that have 0 litters is now working.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Set Up Date when weaning litter</span>: When weaning a litter, we fixed the issue that was causing the Cage Set Up date to default to today's date instead of the litter's wean date when ungrouping/grouping weanlings.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Wean Date Filter on the Litter List</span>: The issue whereby the Wean Date range on the litter filter was not pulling up all records is now fixed. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">End a Litter remains checked</span>: When ending a litter with no pups, the litter is now successfully removed from the list and is no longer checked. So if you check another litter and click Edit Litter, the ended litter will no longer show up, as it shouldn't!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse Comments show aligned with the correct rows on Cage List</span>: On the Cage List Mouse Comment columns, the comments now align properly with the rest of the mouse columns so that you can easily see which comment refers to which mouse in a cage. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Limit number of records that can deleted at a time to improve performance</span>: In order to improve the performance of the system, we added a temporary fix to the Mouse and Litter Delete Records buttons by limiting the number of records that can be deleted at a time. Because deleting records checks and removes every relationship a mouse has in the database, when deleting multiple records at a time, this can be resource intensive and can cause performance lags. We are working on a more permanent solution, and so temporarily limited how many records can be deleted to avoid the performance lag. Stay tuned for a more lasting solution!</li>

<span class="mediumfont blackfont bold">SoftMouseDB v 4.1.6 on February 16, 2018</span><br><br>
			
<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Associate Mouselines with Genes and Genes with Alleles</span>: A new tool menu has been added to the top right of the blue menu header in the colony section allowing you to make associations between your Mouselines and your Genes as well as your Genes and Alleles. The idea is to avoid making mistakes when entering genotype data by ensuring only those genes possible for the selected mouseline and only those alleles possible for the selected gene are available in the drop down lists. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Archive items in customizable drop down lists</span>: A new Archive button was added to all customizable drop down lists, including genes and alleles, so that you may archive any items no longer in use with your current colony. Archiving an item versus deleting it allows for historical data to remain intact while enabling your drop down lists to be current. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Field Sharing capability under admin settings for group accounts</span>: The admin of group accounts can now set specific field sharing permissions so that View Only accounts can edit only Genotype and Comment data, without changing or modifying any other data associated with the mouse. This new Field Sharing menu appears on the admin panel of lab admin accounts.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Last modified date added to the Cage List</span>: A new column was added to the Cage List showing the date of last modification so that you can easily see which cages were most recently modified and re-print cage cards if needed. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Protocol added to the Cage List Filter</span>: The Protocol drop down was added to the Cage List filter so that you may now filter your Cage List by protocol.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Retire multiple breeders from Mating List</span>: Do you ever need to retire the male breeder from multiple mating cages as a time while still leaving the (perhaps pregnant) female active in the mating? A new Retire Breeder button was added to the Mating List to allow you to do just that! </li>
						</ol>	
				
						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Calendar Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Calendar sync emails hyperlink to the event</span>: When synching your SoftMouse calendar with your personal calendar, the associated event is now hyperlinked in the notification email so that you can quickly view the calendar event and associated records in just one click. </li>
							
						</ol>
						
						<span class="bold darkredfont">Defect Fixes</span>:
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Ending all mice in an experiment</span>: Clicking the select all check box on the edit experiment page then ending the mice previously had a defect that was preventing the mice from being ended, this has been fixed.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Ending a litter with one pup</span>: An issue was preventing ended litters that only had one pup to be successfully removed from the Litter List. This has now been addressed and ended litters with one pup will be automatically archived.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Ending a Litter with no pups</span>: When ending a litter with no pups from the litter list, the litter would only show as archived after the page refreshes. Not anymore! The litter list will refresh automatically and the litter will be automatically archived.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Calendar linked records being removed</span>: We addressed an issue whereby calendar associated records were being removed when the save button was clicked multiple times. The associated events will now remain in place on the calendar event. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Calendar repeated event editing</span>: We addressed the issue in the Calendar repeated events whereby if you wanted to change the description of one event in the series, you had to save twice. This works correctly now where you only need to click Save once.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Protocol column of exported / printed lists showing previous protocol</span>: When printing or exporting a list of mice who has had its protocol changed, the previous protocol was showing in the exported file. This has been fixed and now the correct current protocol will show in the export. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Protocol Filtering showing the same mouse twice</span>: When filtering the Mouse List by protocol, sometimes the same mouse would display twice. This has been fixed. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Strain deletion issue</span>: You can now successfully delete strains from the New or Edit Mouseline page. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">New Mouseline page Strain list owner issue</span>: We fixed an issue on the New Mouseline page for group accounts whereby the Strain list was showing the strains of the incorrect owner. Now the Strain list correctly displays the owner selected in the drop down.</li>

Specifically, if the parents are of the same line and same generation, the litter generation will be the next up. If the parents are of different generations or different lines, then the litter's generation will be the first in the Generation drop down list. Please note that you need to set your preferred list sequence in the Generation pop up for this to work.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">All Species added as option</span>: If you manage animals other than rats and mice, you can now adjust your Preference settings to All Species, allowing your display to show the generic Animal label instead of Mice and Rats.  </li>

Simply click Customize Table Columns on the Litter List to add in the new columns.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Original Cage SID / Tag / Barcode added to Mouse List</span>: On your Mouse List, if you need to keep track of the first cage a mouse was ever in, you can click Customize Table Columns and select Origin Cage SID or Cage Tag or Cage Barcode. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouseline names can be bold on Cage Cards</span>: The admin of your SoftMouse account can now set the Mouseline name in bold on the Cage Card to allow the name to stand out more on your printed cage cards. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Vertical Cage Card display</span>: On Vertical Cage Cards, the border line between the genotype and animal information has been lightened thereby making it easier to distinguish between animals in the cage. </li>
							
						</ol>
						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Projects Features:</span>
						<ol>

						</ol>					
						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Calendar Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">View All link in calendar no longer linked to the Filter</span>: When clicking the View All link in the edit Event page to go to the List of records associated with that event, the list filter will auto reset to select the correct owner instead of displaying the previously filtered owner.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<span class="bold darkredfont">Defect Fixes</span>:
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse Filter Age parameter</span>: We fixed two issues with the mouse filter age parameter: 1. When filtering by age, leaving the page and returning, the age remains filtered instead of resetting. 2. Filtering by age AND cage on the Mouse Filter now works as it should.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Filter Age parameter</span>: The Cage Filter age parameter now works as it should.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Checking for duplicate Tags on alive mice</span>: When tagging new pups on the litter list, previously the system would only check for duplicated tags on the first tag entered. Now the whole sequence gets checks properly to ensure there are no duplicate tags with other animals in the colony</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Line spacing when group editing Mouselines</span>: When group editing mouselines, the comment field no longer removes spacing which was previously causing (quite annoyingly!) the entire comment to appear on one line. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Calendar display when only some mouselines shared</span>: On group accounts, when only some mouselines are shared, the calendar wouldn't display the weanings associated with the shared mouselines. This has been addressed.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Strain display on edit mating page</span>: The litter strain now displays properly on the Edit Mating page, for a mating that has a Litter Strain.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Weaning of deleted pups</span>: When deleting pups then weaning, the deleted pups would previously show on the Move Mice page. Deleted pups no longer show on the Move Mice page. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Deleting pups in a weaned litter</span>: When weaning a litter, if you weaned some pups, then deleted the rest, the litter would remain active. This has been addressed and the litter with some weaned, some deleted pups now shows correctly as weaned.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Adding comments on End Mice page</span>: When mice had no previous comments, and new comments were added on the End Mice page, the Append or Replace message would previously show when it shouldn't. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Move Type on Move Summary export</span>: The Move Type column on the Move Summary exported file would previously show jumbled. This has been fixed so the Move Type now matches the columns on the screen. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Updating Mating Set Up and Breeder Date Mated</span>: When updating the Mating set up date on the Group Edit Mating, the individual date mated of the breeders now updates automatically to reflect the change.  </li>

							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter creator vs. Mating owner</span>: The litter creator was previously showing as the owner of the mating record that the litter originated from instead of the actual litter creator. This has been addressed to properly reflect the actual creator of the litter record.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Type in Edit Experiment filter</span>: The Cage Type drop down in the Edit Experiment Mouse Filter is now fixed. </li>

<span class="mediumfont blackfont bold">SoftMouseDB v 4.1.4 on October 6, 2017</span><br><br>
			
						<span class="bold redfont">Important workflow changes to be aware of:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Genotype drop down based on parents</span>:  When adding genotypes to new pups on the Edit Litter page, the Gene drop down list has been narrowed down to only display the genes present in the parents of the litter, making it easier to add genotypes to your pups. (Note if you prefer to see all the genes in your drop down, simply click the new Show All Genes checkbox below the Gene drop down!)</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Remove check box was replaced by an "x" in the genotype box</span>:  On all pages where the Genotype box is present (e.g. Mouse Filter, Edit Mouse page, Edit Litter page, etc.) we replaced the checkbox that was present to previously remove genes from the box by a one click grey x to the right of the gene name. We realized that the check box was causing some confusion among users, who though they the box needed to be checked in order to save the genotype. We like saving you clicks - hope this helps! </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Add Mouse to Experiment filter default settings</span>: We understand that most animals being selected for experiments are ones that are not mating and not already in an experiment. As such, the Add Mouse to Experiment filter now loads only Stock mice who are not already in another experiment thereby making your experimental animal selection more streamlined.   </li>
						</ol>
						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Animal comments added to Cage List</span>: A new column option has been added to the Cage List allowing you to view the comments entered in your animal records in your Cage List. Simply click "Customize Table Columns" on your Cage List and select "Mouse Comments" and save. Note that for ease of viewing, only the first 20 characters of the animal's comments will display. To see more, simply click on the cage to edit it and view the animal comments in the Resident Mice table.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Sex assignment on Wean Litter page</span>:  You can now assign the sex of your animals on the Wean Litter page allowing you to tag, sex and wean multiple litters all in the same workflow!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Comment field added to the End Mice page</span>: When ending a group of animals at the same time, you can now add a comment to the group of them via a common comment field. If a comment already exists for the animals you wish to end, you can easily append a new comment without overwriting what is already there - you can of course choose to overwrite if that's what you prefer! </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Short cuts added to Edit Mouse page</span>: A new yellow drop down was added to the Edit Mouse page to give you a short cut to the End Mice and Move Mice pages. Just another option added to get you to where you need to go faster! </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Filter New Mating page by Cage Type</span>: A new filter parameter was added to the New Mating page, so you can narrow your Male and Female lists down by the Cage Type that they are in.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Print Cage Cards added to Mating List</span>: Whether you prefer to print your cage cards from your Mating List or Cage List, you now have the option to do both! </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Short cut added to view all mice produced from a mating</span>: On your Edit Mating page, in the Litter Information table, a new link has been added to View All Mouse Records so that you can quickly get a list of all of the pups produced from that mating, regardless of their current alive status.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse comment added to the Family Tree</span>: When viewing mice in the Family tree, you can now see the comment that was added to the mouse on the (computer!) mouse roll over.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Coat Color added to Cage Cards</span>: On your Cage Card template, you can now add Coat Color as an option.  </li>

							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Tag added to Edit Mouse page</span>: If you track Litter Tags to your Litter, this tag now shows up on the Edit Mouse page for all mice born to litters with a Litter Tag.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Character limits removed from the Filter text fields</span>: You can now enter as many tags / SID as you like in the Filter fields. (Previously the SID and tags filter fields were limited in space so you could only search for a few tags / sids at the same time.)   </li>

						</ol>
						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Projects Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Export List added to the Mice in this Experiment section</span>: On your Edit Experiment page, you can now export the list of mice participating in the experiment from the Mice in this Experiment Section.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Type added to the Mouse Filter on Edit Experiment</span>: When adding mice to an experiment, you can now search for animals by their Cage Type in the Add Mice to Experiment filter. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Time Elapsed added to Experiments</span>: Based on when an experiment was started (i.e. the Experiment Start Date), a new Time Elapsed counter was added to show how many days (weeks) has passed since the experiment started.  </li>

						</ol>					
						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Calendar Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Calendar syncing</span>: We heard you loud and clear and are happy to announce that you can now sync your SoftMouse calendar to your work calendar (e.g. Google Calendar, Outlook, iCal). To enable the setting, please click your My Preference menu, and select the checkbox for "Send to my Calendar". When a new event is added to the calendar for weaning, tail/tagging or custom inputted events, you will receive an email with a .ics attachment and the event will load automatically to the calendar associated with your SoftMouse email address in your Profile. Please note that Experimental Events are still pending for the calendar sync. Stay tuned! </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Filter by all owners</span>: If you want to see the calendar events from all users, you can now filter the Owner drop down on the calendar by "All" </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Created By added to Calendar events</span>: The name of the person who created custom calendar events now shows on the Event page so you can track who created the event.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Description section was increased</span>: The description section of the Event page was increased so that you can see more rows with a scroll.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Associated Records section has a scroll</span>: If you add a large number of records to an event in the calendar, the associated records section now has a scroll so you can see all the records as well as the "View All" link. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Event history table showing on edit pages</span>: When adding colony records to your calendar events, you now have a full history of the events on the Edit page for the record in question, allowing you to see a full history of all key events associated with the record. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Tail/Tag check box on Litter Edit page now linked to calendar with strikethrough on the event</span>: When marking a Tail Tag date as completed by checking the box on the associated Edit Litter page, the associated Tail/Tag date in your calendar now shows a strikethrough indicating that the task was completed.  </li>
						</ol>
						
						<span class="bold darkredfont">Defect Fixes</span>:
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Adding mice to mating filter</span>: If you have over 200 rows displaying the Add Mouse to Mating filter would previously be unresponsive. This has been fixed so you can now increase the number of rows showing per page on your My Preference page and filter your Add Mouse to Mating list on the Mating Edit page with no issue. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating Tag / Mating SID columns exporting on the Cage List</span>: We fixed the issue that was preventing the Mating SID and Mating Tag columns from displaying the corresponding data on the Export of the Cage List.   </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouseline drop down selection on New Mating page</span>: Previously when filtering your New Mating page, the Litter Mouseline drop down at the bottom of the page would need to be opened and selected twice. This has been rectified so it works as expected with the selection only needing to happen once as expected.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Select multiple owners and print cards</span>: When filtering your cage list by multiple owners, you can now print the resulting Cage Cards without an issue.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Export Order fixed on Move Summary export</span>: The row order has been addressed when exporting the updated cages from the Move Summary page (previously the order of the rows would be scrambled in the Exported list). </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Language on exported files</span>: The exported list columns now always show in English even if your operating system is in another language - as long as your SoftMouse account language preferences are set to English of course!  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">New Mouse drop down order</span>: The New Mice page drop down lists were previously showing in alphabetical order even if the lists has been reordered using the Move Up and Move Down arrows. Now the New Mice drop downs show the correct preferred order of your content.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">End Date saving on Litter pages</span>: When ending an entire litter on the Litter Edit page, the End Date was always saving as today's date even though a new date was selected on the End Date calendar. This has been fixed so the date selected is what gets saved.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Reset button on New Litter page leaves the owner as is</span>: When adding litters to the matings of another owner, we fixed an issue on the Reset button which was causing the Owner drop down to change to "Me" instead of leaving it as it was on the owner of the litters.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Change wean date saving</span>: When changing the wean date at the time of weaning, the new wean date was only being updated on the mice being weaned and the litter record was still showing the default wean date. This has been address and the litter record now correctly reflects the changed wean date. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Family Tree icons</span>: If a mouse searched for in the Family Tree doesn't have any offspring, the icon for the mouse was always showing as male (rectangle), even if the searched for mouse is female (circle). The icon now correctly reflects the sex of the mouse with no issue. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">New Litter button on Edit Cage</span>: Previously if using the Chrome browser, if you clicked the New Litter button on the Edit Cage page, the page would refresh continuously preventing you from adding in the litter. This has been fixed so you can easily add in New Litters from the Edit Cage page without the continuous refresh happening.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Sex and Date filters in Add Mouse to Experiment</span>:  The Sex and Date range filters in the Add Mouse to Experiment filter on the Edit Experiment page was previously unresponsive. This has been fixed so that you can filter with no issues to find new mice to add into Experimental records. </li>

						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features and Adjustments:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Genotype has been Added to the Cage Filter</span>: On your Cage List Filter, you can now easily narrow down your search by Genotype to locate cages of interest. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Display Ended Mice Last Cage SID / Cage Tag</span>: When searching for ended mice, in your Mouse List, you will now be able to see the last cage that the mouse was in the Cage SID and Cage Tag field, which were previously showing as blank. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Reactivating an ended mouse back to its last cage</span>: When reactivating an ended mouse, the system will now put that mouse back into the cage it was last in before being ended. Note that if the mouse was in two cages on the date of its death (e.g. it was moved from one cage to another on the same date that it died), you will need to manually put the mouse back to it's last cage using the Move Mcie feature and the database won't know which of the two cages it was last in.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">End Date of Litter Populated Automatically</span>: When ending a litter where all pups have the same end date, the Litter End Date will also be populated with this End Date as well allowing you to see the date of end at the level of the litter. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Sorting of Tags in the Edit Cage Page</span>: In the Resident Mice table on the Edit Cage page, the listed mice are now default sorted by the Physical Tag.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Open Links in a new tab by right clicking</span>: if you right click any link, you can click "Open in New Tab" to open the resulting page into a new browser tab allowing you to visualize multiple data records very easily in different tabs.</li>
						</ol>
						<span class="bold darkredfont">Defect Fixes</span>:
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Deleted Litter no longer shows on the Cage Card</span>: Any deleted litter was accidentally being displayed on the Cage Card. We have taken care of this little glitch!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Tags with RapIDs searchable in Edit Experiment</span>: For those using RapIDs, the Search feature on the Enter Value table of experiments was not searching RapIDs, this has also been fixed. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Group Editing More than 30 Mice</span>: We fixed an issue that was preventing more than 30 mice from being group edited, specifically when changing any date setting. You can now group edit 100 mice with no problems!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Alt. ID on Wean Litter page</span>: When adding the Alt. ID on the Wean Litter page, on moving the weanlings to their new cages, the Alt. IDs would have an issue saving. This has also been fixed now. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Date formats not showing correctly</span>: The date format on the Family Tree and New Mice page now follow the date format set in the preference menu. </li>

							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Append to existing comments</span>: When adding a comment on any of the Group Edit Mouse pages, if one or more of the mice in question already have a comment, the system will now prompt you of whether you want to append to or replace the existing comment with the new comment.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">List Calendar events in Edit Mouse page</span>: On the Edit Mice page, you can now view a list of all custom events created for that mouse in the calendar, aggregating all activities for the mouse in one location.   </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating Set Up Date added to Litter List</span>: You can now add the Mating Set Up date on the Litter List as a column option.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter List Mouseline column sorting</span>: You can now sort your Litter List by the Mouseline column. </li>

							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">% in Comment fields</span>: On the Group Edit Mouse page, previously if a % was saved inside a comment of a mouse, then no other changes were being save - no more! You can now save any information to a mouse with a % in the comment with no issues!</li>

						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Major Updates:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Protocols</span>: We have begun the roll out of the new SoftMouse Protocol feature. As part of this Protocols v1 release, you can now add/edit/remove protocols from the new Protocols menu (to the left of the Family Tree menu), associate protocols with mice, print protocols on cage cards and query your Mouse List for mice by a specific protocol. Subsequent releases over the coming weeks will see more automation built in so that you can automatically associate mice with the same protocols as their parents (for example), and specify the connection between protocols and mouselines. Stay tuned! Also, if you need help transferring data from another SoftMouse field into the new Protocol field, please contact our support desk at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="077472777768757347746861736a6872746229696273">[email&#160;protected]</a> - we are here to help!</li>
						</ol>

						<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Update to the Cage Filter Disposition Parameter</span>: We added a new option to the Cage List filter under the Disposition drop down so that you can now filter by All Stock mice (not just stock males or stock females as it was doing previously). Note that in this drop down, Stock simply refers to non-mating mice, thereby incorporating both Stocks and Weanlings.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Mouseline column added to Cage List</span>: For mating cages, we added a new "Litter Mouseline" column option to the Cage List so that you can see the mouseline of the resulting litter from that mating in the cage list.</li>
						</ol>

						<span class="bold darkredfont">Minor Adjustments and Fixes</span>:
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Removed Retired / Ended Breeders from Exported/Printed lists</span>: When exporting/printing your Mating List, we removed from view the retired / ended animals in the resulting spreadsheet / PDF file so that only active breeders show in the print out making it clear who is still present in the mating (and who is not!). </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Status Drop Down for Group Accounts</span>: For group accounts, the Cage Status drop down was not displaying the correct data associated with the owner of the mice in the cage, causing much confusion! We fixed this to ensure the correct Cage Status was showing for the correct owners. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Time Zone Issue Addressed on New Litter Page</span>: The DOB for litter was not saving correctly when inputted on the New Litter page for SoftMouse users in time zones ahead of EST. This has been fixed so DOBs will save exactly as they are inputted now. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Customized Content Sorting in the Mouse List</span>: The content inputted into any of the customizable drop downs (Alt. ID, Notice, Category, Status, etc.) now sorts in alphabetical order in the Mouse List. </li>

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Major Updates:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Intregration with RapidLab RapID Tags</span>: For those of you using the colored <a href="https://rapidlab.com/" target="_blank"> RapidLab's RapID Tags</a>, SoftMouse now integrates seamlessly with these tags. Simply go to your Preference page, enable the tags (bottom of the General Preferences) and start scanning your tags straight into the Physical Tag field! Note that you can also update your Cage Card preferences to see the RapIDs on your cage card print outs as well. Enjoy! </li>
						</ol>

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features:</span>
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Filter Cages by Age / Date of Birth</span>: You can now easily look up specific cages by the age / date of birth of the resident mice. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Filter Cages by End Date range</span>: If you ever need to find how many cages were taken down within a specific date range, you can now filter your Cage List by Date of End for the cages.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Display Parent Tags and Genotypes in the Cage List</span>: By clicking the Customize Table Columns button on your Cage List, you can now select Dam Tag/Genotype and Sire Tag/Genotype as column options to quickly trace the lineage of mice straight from your cage list!</li>
						</ol>

					<span class="bold darkredfont">Minor Adjustments and Fixes</span>:
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Age display</span>: Regardless of your age display preference (days, weeks, months, etc.), the age of your pups will now always display in days to make it easier to track pup age. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouseline Average #pups/litter update</span>: The calculation for the average number of pups per litter has been updated to exclude litters created that have not been weaned AND that have no pups created in the litter as yet so as not to skew the average lower. The unweaned litter with no pups will automatically be counted towards the average as soon as the litter size has been inputted.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Order issue on New Litter page</span>: When selecting matings to create litters, the order in which the matings were selected had a direct impact on which litters showed under which mating on the New Litter page, causing much confusion for those looking for the litter info for each mating! This has been addressed, so the correct litters are showing under the correct mating regardless of the order in which the matings were selected. </li>

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features:</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Filter Cage by Disposition</span>: You can now look for specific Mating Cages, or Stock Females or Stock Males from your Cage List Filter! Navigate to your Cage List, Open the Filter and select your desired option from the "Disposition" drop down. </li>
						</ol>	

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Project Features:</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Experimental Template Time Point</span>: You can now set up Time Point to your experimental templates. Running the same study design on different cohorts has never been easier! Simply set up your variables in the Templates section of the Project module - be sure to include the Time Point for each variable. Then when creating your experiment, select the desired template and simply input the start date of this specific experiment!</li>
						</ol>					

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">Minor design updates:</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Scrolls on lists</span>: All of the main lists (e.g. Mouse List, Mating List, Cage List etc.) have been updated to auto-size to your screen size thereby removing the need for multiple vertical scrolls on the same page. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Scrolls in the customizable pop up</span>: Ever tried to rearrange the content in one of the customizable drop down lists (e.g. gene, allele, category, etc.) using the Move Up and Move down buttons and found that the buttons would remove from the screen when the list was very long? No more! We have fixed the buttons on the screen so that you can easily rearrange your content in a few quick clicks and easy scrolling! </li>

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features!</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Vertical Cage Cards</span>:  For those with vertical / portrait orientated cage cards, you can now select "Vertical" and an orientation for your SoftMouse Cage Cards in your My Preferences menu. Note that this menu is only available for the Lab Administrator of your SoftMouse account. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Range Filtering </span>: For your Tag and SIDs filter fields, you can now filter by range of numbers, along with more than one Tag / SID at a time that are not in a range. Note that for range filtering, you must separate the range by a dash with two spaces on either side, e.g. "4015 - 4030", NOT "4015-4030". Also, for "and" filtering, you must use a semi colony (;) to separate tags/ids and leave NO space on either side, e.g. "4015;3634", NOT "4015; 3634" or "4015 ; 3634". </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Replacing / Removing Genes in Complex Genotypes</span>:  You can now remove or replace single gene / alele combinations in complex genotypes on the Group Edit Mouse page. Specifically if you notice a mistake in a series of gene (e.g. +/- for one of the genes in the genotype instead of +/+), on your Group Edit Mouse page, simply add in the correct gene / allele combination and the system will ask you if you want to replace or remove that single gene in the string - no more need to erase the entire genotype and entire it all back in!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Procedure Date and Tail Tag Date can be cleared</span>: If the wrong Procedure Date or a Tail Tag Date was added to a Mouse accidentally, instead of only being able to change the date to another datte, you can now clear the field completely by clicking the red X beside the corresponding field on the Edit Mouse record page. </li>
						</ol>	
				
					<br>
					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Column options</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating Partner's Genotype in Mouse List</span>: The Mating Partner's genotype was added as a selectable column option in the Mouse List displaying the genotype of the current mating partner of the mouse. </li>
						</ol>
					<br>																			
					<span class="bold darkredfont">Minor Adjustments and Fixes</span>: 
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Group Edit Mouselines removes Strains</span>: When group editing multiple mouselines, the associated strains would disappear. This has now been fixed so associated strains always remain with their mouseline. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Group Edit Cages Set Up Date</span>: When changing the Set Up Date on the Group Edit Cage page, the system previously was not able to recorgnize the new date. We have addressed this to ensure cage set up date's can be changed properly. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Group Account Cage List Mouseline Filter</span>: We addressed an issue in the Cage List Filter whereby the Mouseline drop down wouldn't respond to show another user's mouseline content after a new owner was selected. </li>

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features!</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating Mice added to Filter Mode</span>: Filtering by Mice who have ever been mated just got easier! If you need to prepare a report counting all mice that have ever been mated within a given time frame, you can now select "Mated Mice" from the Filter Mode in the Mouse List Filter. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">New Litter button added to Edit Cage</span>: When scanning your cage's QR code to enter a new litter to a Mating cage, you can now click the New Litter button straight from the Cage Record page saving you 3 clicks!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Card Updates</span>: We added a few more options to the Cage Cards, namely Mouse SID to the Mouse table, and total litter number and Tail Tag Date to the Litter table.</li>
						</ol>	
				
					<br>
					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Calendar Features!</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">View All link back to records</span>: For calendar events that have associated records (e.g. Mouse records, Mating records, etc.), we have added a View All link inside the event itself. On click of this link, you will be directed to a filtered list with only the records from your event. For example, if you set up a Sac event with 3 mice, then clicking "View All" in the event will take you to your Mouse List with just the 3 mouse records showing allowing you to quickly select and End.  </li>

						</ol>
					<br>
					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Column options</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mature Date added to the Litter List</span>: The Mature Date of pups in a litter was added as a selectable column option in the Litter List. </li>
						</ol>
					<br>																			
					<span class="bold darkredfont">Minor Adjustments and Fixes</span>: 
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Sorting of all tags</span>: We have enhanced the sorting or all tag fields making it more natural. Previously if your cage tags were 1, 8, 10, 20, sorting your Cage List by Cage Tag would display your cages ordered as: 1, 10, 20, 8 because it would sort by the first character (i.e. alphanumerically). We have addressed this to make the sorting more natural, i.e. displaying the numbers ordered as 1, 8, 10, 20 - as a human would expect! </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Ending Mice from the Experiment page</span>: When ending mice from the Edit Experiment page, the End Type was not always saving correctly. This has now been addressed so that the End Type inputted will save to the database. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Default Mature Date when adding pups to litters</span>: When adding pups to an existing litter, the mature date was automatically being calculated as DOB + 42 days instead of taking the default mature age as set in the Mouseline page. This has now bee addressed so that the Mature Date will always be calculated based on the default you inputted.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Age of Dam and Sire in the Mouse List</span>: We fixed an issue that was giving the wrong age for the Dam and Sire in the Mouse. The parental ages are now showing correctly.</li>						
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">User lists in alphabetical order</span>: For all the group accounts, we alphabetized all of the user drop down lists (e.g. owner drop down in the filters) making it easier to quickly locate a user of interest.</li>
						</ol>

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Colony Features!</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Showing Deactivated Cages in Move Summary</span>: When moving mice, if a cage has been made inactive (due to the last mouse in the cage having been moved out), the Move Summary page will now show you the list of deactivated cages in addition to showing the updated and new cages. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Card Updates</span>: By popular demand we have bolded the font on the cage cards and darkened the lines around the mouse tables making it easier to see the information on the card. More small tweaks are to come shortly on the cage cards - stay tuned! </li>

						</ol>	
				
					<br>
					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Project Features!</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Enter Value table column updates</span>: We have added the Cage SID to the Enter Value table on the edit experiment page. We have also made the Mouse SID column freeze so that it stays in place as you scroll your Enter Value table horizontally. You can also now add / remove the Mouseline and Genotype column options if you wish to view or hide these columns in your experiment. </li>
						</ol>
					<br>
																			
					<span class="bold darkredfont">Minor Adjustments and Fixes</span>: 
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Ending a Litter on mobile</span>: When ending a litter with no pups on a mobile device, we fixed a minor issue that was causing the Submit button to be hidden in the End Pop up box, thus preventing the litter from being able to be successfully ended. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter in Cages</span>: Previously if a male was moved out of a breeding cage that just produced a litter, the litter information would show in the associated column on the Cage list for both the female AND the male. We have addressed this issue so that the litter columns of the cage list are only populated for the mother's cage. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Search Enter Value table not case sensitive</span>: We have removed the case sensitivity on the Enter Value table searching on the Edit Experiment page.</li>

					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Table Columns Added</span>: 
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Dam Cage SID added to Litter List</span>: If you have not as yet added pups to a Litter, you will notice that the Cage SID field will be blank in your Litter List making it hard to identify which cage the litter is in. We have added the Dam Cage SID as a column option to the Litter List to allieviate this issue as the litter will naturally be in the same cage as its mother. </li>

						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Print Cage Cards</span>: You can now print out cage cards straight from your SoftMouse account - that's right, no more handwriting cards anymore! Simply click the Print Cage Cards button on your Move Summary page every time you execute a cage update, or select the desired cages from your Cage List and print the cards at any time! If you are the SoftMouse administrator for your lab's account, click the Preferences tab in the admin panel and customize the content you wish to see on your cards.</li> 
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">SoftMouse for Rats</span>: Do you manage a rat colony, not a mouse colony? No problem! In your Preferences tab, simply select your animal of choice for all parameters to be changed to your preferred species. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Tail / Tag Date Reminders</span>: You can now receive reminders for when you need to tag / tail your mice. Similar to the Wean Date, you can specify the Tail/Tag age on a mouseline by mouseline basis. Then when you create a litter within that Mouseline, your SoftMouse account will automatically calculate the Tail / Tag date, put this date in your calendar and then send you an email reminder (if desired) a day before the date. Make sure to click "Customize Table Columns" to select the Tail / Tag Date column option in your Litter List. </li>							
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Tag and Barcode searchable on Move Mice Page</span>: When moving mice into an existing cage on the Move Mice page, you can now search for that existing cage straight from within the Cage Tag and Cage Barcode fields of the Cage Information section of the table. You no longer need to use the filter! Simply start typing the Cage Tag or Cage Barcode straight into the corresponding fields and select the desired existing cage from the drop down. Note that the number in parentheses is the Cage System Identifier (Cage SID).</li>

						</ol>
					<br>
					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Project Features!</span>
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">View/Hide Inactive Experiments</span>: The Experiment List is now auto filtered by experiments that have active mice, i.e. active experiments. Experiments in which all mice are inactive (e.g. all dead or all removed from the experiment) are now auto-archived. Simply click the black button on your Experiment List to choose to view Active, Inactive or All Experiments.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Edit Mice added on Edit Experiment page</span>:  Need to change the tag, or add a notice or comment to a mouse in an experiment? You can now save a few clicks by using the new Edit Mice button in the "Mice in this Experiment" section within the Edit Experiment page!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Identify Removed Mice from Experiment with Grey Color</span>: Mice that have been removed from an experiment now show in grey color font to easily distinguish the mice that are still active in the experiment from those that are no longer active. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Export added to Project Edit page </span>: You can export a list of all experiments within a single project by clicking the new Export Experiments button on the Edit Project page.</li>
						</ol>
					<br>
					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">New Table Columns Added</span>: 
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Last Updated column added to Experiment List</span>: If you want to see when an experiment was last updated with an experimental value, you can now do so by adding the Last Updated column to your Experiment List.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouseline of breeders added to Mating list</span>: The Mouselines of the male and female breeders can now be selected as column options to the Mating List for increased discernibility when looking for specific crosses.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouseline and Alt IDs of parents added to Litter list</span>: Similar to the above, the Mouselines and Alt ID.s of the dam and sire can now be selected as column options in your Litter List.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Barcode added to Mouse and Mating Lists</span>: The Cage Barcode has been added as a column option to your Mouse List and Mating List for easy identification of mice / breeders in barcoded cages.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Updated Litter Column of Cage List</span>: For cages that contain a litter, your existing Litter SIDs and Litter Tags columns now display the Litter Size, DOB, Wean Date so that you have full access to the information of litter in each cage without having to click for the details. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Experiment column added to Cage List</span>: For those of you who have added mice in the Projects module, you can now tell which cages contain mice in particular experiments by scanning the new Experiment column of your Cage List.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Dam Cage Tag added to Litter List</span>: If you have not as yet added pups to a Litter, you will notice that the Cage Tag field will be blank in your Litter List making it hard to identify which cage the litter is in. We have added the Dam Cage Tag as a column option to the Litter List to allieviate this issue as the litter will naturally be in the same cage as its mother. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating Partner Tag and SID added to the Mouse List</span>: If you would like a glimpse into who the mating partners are of individual mice from your Mouse List without having to click to view the Mating History, you can now select to display the Mating Partner Tag and Mating Partner SID as column options in the Mouse List.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Tag added to Cage List</span>: The Litter Tag column was added to the Cage List to denote the Litter Tag for each mouse in the cage. If you use this field to track parental cage of a mouse, you will now have visibility into the cage of origination for your mice straight from your Cage List!</li>
						</ol>
					<br>
									
					<span class="bold darkgreenfont">Sort and Filtering Updates</span>: 
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Added Creator to Mating List and Cage List Filters</span>: You can now filter your Mating List and Cage List by the creator of the record. This is especially useful in Group Accounts where individual users are contributing records to a centrally owned database. If you want to search for all records created by one person, you can now do so with this new Creator filter parameter. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Time Since Last Litter column is now sortable in the Mating List</span>: You are now able to sort the "Since last litter" column in the Mating List, making it easier to quickly identify which cages need to be checked for litters or separated for lack of litters.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Barcode added to Cage Filter</span>: You can now filter your Cage List by the Barcode field.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Procedure Date and Tag / Tail Date added to Mouse Filter</span>: We have updated the Mouse Filter to include the Procedure Date and Tag / Tail Date filter range parameters. </li>
						</ol>
					<br>

										
					<span class="bold darkredfont">Minor Adjustments and Fixes</span>: 
						<ol>			
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mice in Edit Experiment page ordered by Tag</span>:  The Mouse List in the Mice in this Experiment section is now ordered by the Physical Tag column by default.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Sex and Status added to Wean Reminders</span>: On your Calendar and in your Wean Reminder emails, the Litter size is now broken down by sex and the Litter Status had been aded to better visualize what needs to be weaned without having to further click for details.  </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">User Preferences Now Tabbed Pages </span>: The Preference page was subdivided into various tabs to make for easier management of the variety of preferences and customizations you can set for your SoftMouse account. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Unsexed Ended Mice Continue to Display as Unknown</span>: If you ended pups before sexing them, then when adding male and female on your Edit page, the sex of the ended pups no longer auto-changes - the unsexed mice remain Unknown while only the sex of the alive mice will change.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Wean Reminders for End Litters</span>: The Wean email alerts were previously coming even if the entire litter was Ended Litters. This is no longer the case - you will now only receive email reminders for unweaned litters.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Age Range on New Mating Page</span>: The New Mating page filter by Age range is now functioning as expected.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Size column on Litter List showing deleted pups</span>: If a pup was deleted from the litter, in the Litter Size column of your Litter List, this deleted pup was still being counted towards to total size of the litter - this has been addressed and the litter size is now only counting alive or ended pups.</li>							
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter Age for Ended pups</span>: We fixed the issue that was causing the age of an ended litter to continue to increase even after the End Date of the litter was entered. The Age of an Ended Litter now stops counting on the End Date itself, giving you the accurate age at end for a litter. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Fixed Timezone Issue when adding New Litter</span>: Your timezone no longer influences when the timestamp is applied to newly created litter. </li>

					<span class="bold greenfont">New features</span>: 
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Alternative ID (Alt. ID) has been added for mice</span>: If you use an Ear Mark system or Toe tagging system or other to tag your mice, there is now a new drop down field added to your Mouse List. Simply click on the Edit Table link on the Mouse List and select Alt ID to expose this column in your Mouse List. When tagging your animals with this new function, on any of the corresponding Edit pages, you can select the correct Alternative ID directly from the Mouse table. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Order selection for custom drop down list content </span>: For all customized drop down lists (e.g. Notice, Category, Status, End Type, End Date, etc.), you can now set the lists in your order of preference.

							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">End Type and End Reason drop downs for groups </span>: In group accounts, when filtering by another user and ending a mouse, the End Type and End Reason drop down lists have been fixed to show the correct user's content.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Comment field in the Pup Information table</span>: In the Litter Edit page, when editing the pups, a defect has been fixed that was preventing the comment field from back saved when typing directly in the Pup Information table comment field.  </li>

<span class="mediumfont blackfont bold">SoftMouseDB v 3.0.0 on March 22, 2014</span><br><br>

					
					<span class="bold greenfont">MAJOR version 3 New features / updates</span>: 
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">My Account process</span>: If you are the admin of your SoftMouse account, your SoftMouse account management process just got easier! Simply click the My Account menu in the Admin section of SoftMouse and view when your account is set to expire. Click Renew, Upgrade or Downgrade to process your payment.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Family Tree Beta!</span>: The Family Tree is currently in Beta release. Feel free to give it a try and let us know your feedback, from intuitiveness to functionality! Please note that we have limited the number of generations to 10 (5 generations ancestors and 5 generations of progeny) in the beta release in order to simply monitor server performance as users begin to use this resource intensive feature! As our monitoring progresses, we can certainly adjust our servers in order to increase generation numbers. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mobile Optimization</span>: If you access SoftMouse (www.softmouse.net) on your mobile phone, 7 inch tablet or vertically on your 10 inch tablet, you will notice that the interface has now been simplified to allow for quick and easy data entry on smaller devices.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Filters and Edit text field and drop downs</span>: The text field and drop down content on the filters and edit pages have been organized into columns (versus rows as previously) so as to make for easier selection. To that end, you will notice that the Mouseline drop down is placed in the same spot (top left!) in all filters so that it can be easily located in all filters. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Page Design and Anchors</span>: Generally, the SoftMouse design has been modernized and a few additional goodies have been added for easier navigation. For example, page anchors will now anchor you to the correct spot after making a selection. Test out any of the Filters or Yellow drop down lists in the edit pages to get a taste! For the filter: simply click the filter butotn and you will be anchored to the top of the list, thereby saving time on scrolling. Similarly a "Back to Top" arrow will appear to send you straight back to the top of a page. </li>
						</ol>
					<br>
					<span class="bold greenfont">Additional New features</span>: 
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">New Mating page mouse lists</span>: By popular demand, we have inverted the Male and Female mouse lists in the New Mating page. Many users have brought up the fact that on all lists (Mouse List, Mating List, Litter List), the male/sire columns always appear before the female/dam columns, however on the New Mating page, the lists were ordered to first select the female before the male. This inconsistency has now been cleared up!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter List new Column</span>: A new column option has been added to the Litter List to be able to view the Mouse Tags, Sex and Genotypes of pups in a litter. If you tag, sex and genotype your pups before the Wean Date, or if you simply want to view the details of historical Litter records straight from the Litter List, this column will certainly come in handy.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating List new columns</span>: Four new column options have been added to the Mating List to view the detailed Date Mated and Date Retired of male and female breeders. Exposing these columns in your main Mating List is particularly useful if you often keep the same mating record active and rotate breeders through it. By seeing the last date retired of a male, you will easily be able to tell when to expect a new litter, or when a new male should be added back in!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter and Cage Edit pages Mouse List sorting</span>: The Pup Information table and Resident Mouse table in the Edit Litter and Edit Cage page can now be sorted by the Mouse SID and Mouse Tag columns. This makes it easier when editing mice if you would rather see the mice listed in specific ascending or descending order.</li>
						</ol>
					<br>
					<span class="bold darkredfont">Fixes</span>: 
						<ol>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage and Mating counts</span>: For Group Accounts, we have fixed a major issue that was causing the Cage and Mating count on the Home Page Colony Overview and Mouseline List to be tied to the creator of the record, rather than the owner of the mice in the record. All cage and mating counts now display the proper number of records for each associated mouse owner in the database. </li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Cage Permissions</span>: For Group Accounts, where sharing is set to "View Only", we have fixed an issue causing a Permission message to pop up when accessing a cage containing your own mice, but that was created by another user. This has been rectified as follows: as long as you own mice in a cage, you can edit that cage, period!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse List performance</span>: We have optimized the speed of the Mouse List performance from 10 seconds to load to under 5 seconds. If you are still noticing sluggish load speeds for your Mouse List, please let contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="374442474758454377645851437a5842445219797263">[email&#160;protected]</a> and let us know! (Note that lists that display upwards of 500+ rows per page as set in your Preferences tend to load slower by default)</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouseline printing</span>: An issue has been fixed that was preventing the content in the # of Active Litters, Matings and Cages column in the Mouseline List from being Printed and Exported.</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Litter List printing</span>: An issue has been fixed in the Litter List that was causing and error in the Export or Printing of Litter List Data. You can Print / Export your Litter List with no problem!</li>
							<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">New Mating columns sorting</span>: On the new Mating Page, a defect was addressed that caused data to be hidden from the Male and Female mouse lists when the Cage SID, Cage Tag, Sire SID and Sire Tag were clicked to sort. You can now sort those columns with no issue. </li>
						</ol>

			<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Dam and Sire column information display</span>: In the Mating List and Litter List, we have updated the column display of the female breeders/dam and male breeders/sire to show multiple entries on their own row within the same cell. For example if a mating has more than one female breeders, the genotype column for the female will show the two separate genotypes on their own row (as opposed to on the same row separated by a comma).</li>

	<ol>
				<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Update Colony Overview</span>: On the Home Page, in the Colony Overview section for group accounts, you can now click directly on a user's name and get taken to their SoftMouse records, thereby saving yourself 4 clicks!

				<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Modify Set Up Date and End Date of Cages</span>: Inside the Edit Cage Record, you can now change the Set up date of a cage and the End date of a cage to make the time the cage was active in your facility better reflect reality.</li>

	<ol>		 
				<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Split Mouse columns in Cage List</span>: As per the popular request, we have split the mouse content up into separate columns of the Cage List! Instead of having Mouse genotype, DOB, Litter SID, Mouse Category, etc. all jam packed into one cell, you can now pick and choose which Mouse content you want to see in your Cage List using the Edit Table link. </li>
				<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Add Pups - return of the "Unknown sex" drop down</span>: From our last release where we replaced the single "Unknown sex" drop down list with individual Male and Female drop downs in the Add Pups action box in the Edit Litter page, many of you have missed the Unknown option - so we added it back! When adding new pups to a litter, you can now choose between male, female AND unknown sex.  </li>
				<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Delete multiple litters in a Mating</span>: Ever had trouble adding a new litter to a mating where you had deleted more than one litter?

					<br/><span class="orangefont">- Details:</span> For Mating records with multiple breeders, you will be able to select or modify the parents of any litter produced within this mating record after the litter has been created. 
					<br/><span class="orangefont">- For example:</span> This feature can be useful if  you selected the wrong female as the mother when creating the litter or you forgot to select one specific female as the mother which would result in all females in the mating being possible mothers
					<br/><span class="orangefont">- How to access:</span> To access this feature, simply go to the Edit Page of the litter, select "Edit Parents" from the drop down list and use the check boxes to modify the parental selection, then click Apply button.
					</li> 
					
					<br/><li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Save sorted lists</span>: 
					<br/><span class="orangefont">- Details:</span> Similar to filtering, if you sort a List, then go to another page, then come back to the original List, the List will remain in its previously sorted state
					<br/><span class="orangefont">- For example:</span> If you sort your Mouse List by Category column, then select a Mouse to edit, then return to the Mouse List, the Category columns will remain sorted
					<br/><span class="orangefont">- Note:</span> Only certain columns can be sorted. See the Homepage Known Issues section for a list of the columns that currently do not sort for each List

					<br/><li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse date of birth added to the Cage List</span>:
					<br/><span class="orangefont">- Details:</span> In the Resident Mouse column of the Cage List, the Mouse Date of Birth was added. Also, we have modified this same column so that it shows one mouse per row to make the display easier to see the individual mice within the same cage
					</li>

	<span class="darkredfont bold">Fixed issues:</span>
	
				<ol>
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Sorting issue when printing and exporting Mouse List:</span>
					<br/><span class="orangefont">- Details:</span> When you sort the Mouse List list and then "Print" or "Export" a select few records to a pdf or spreadsheet, the sorted order is now printed / exported in the resulting file. Previously the resulting printed / exported file would not be in the same sorted format as what was selected on the screen. A fix to the remaining of the lists (i.e. Mating List, Litter List, Cage List) will follow shortly.
					</li>
				</ol>

	<span class="darkredfont bold">Additional notes on the recently released Freeze pane feature:</span>
		

				<ol>
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Regarding the Mating List, Litter List and Cage list</span>: 
					<br/>- You will notice that even if you unselect "SID" or "Tag" in the Edit Table Column Chooser, these columns will nevertheless remain on the screen in order to accommodate for their new "frozen" state when horizontally scrolling.
					<br/>- The reason we left these check boxes in the Column Chooser is that when you Print or Export the lists, if the boxes are unselected, then the columns will not display in the printed / exported lists.
					<br/>- In order words, selecting these checkboxes will not affect the columns' display on the interface (i.e. they will show regardless of selection) but will affect their display in the printed and exported lists (i.e. they will not show if unselected). </li>

					<br/><li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Regarding the Mouse List:</span>
					<br/>- We made the "SID" and "Tag" columns in the Mouse List work a little different to the previous lists.
					<br/>- As always, the "Tag" column will always be displayed in the Mouse List - there is no option to hide it.
					<br/>- However we allowed for the SID column to be hidden in the Column Chooser.
					<br/>- The reason is because almost all SoftMouse users do not use the Mouse SID column and so do not wish it to be displayed on the screen.
					<br/>- Furthermore, in order to accommodate for the freezing of the "Physical Tag" column and the "unfreezing" of the SID column, we inverted the Tag and SID columns so that Tag comes first always.
					<br/>- So for those users who wish to display the SID in the Mouse List, you will now notice that it comes after the "Tag" column.</li>

					<br/><li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Regarding the Enter Value table in Edit Experiment page</span>: 
					<br/>- For the Enter Value table in the Edit Experiment page, we temporarily removed the "Freeze column" ability as it was causing the header to split in two and removing the effect of the "freeze".
					<br/>- We are investigating a fix to this issue.</li>

					 <span class="bold">NOTE 2</span>: In the Mating and Litter edit pages, you must first select ended records from your Breeder list or Pup list (respectively) and then select the Reactivate action from the drop down list in order to trigger the Reactivate function - nothing will happen if you click Reactivate without first selecting an ended record. <br/><br/>  
					 <span class="bold">NOTE 3</span>: This feature required significant updating to the interface code - that said, you may need to clear your browser's cache if you notice that nothing happens after clicking the Button. Click this <a class="brightblue bold" target="_blank" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache">link</a> which will explain how to clear your cache depending on your browser version.<br/><br/> 
					 <span class="bold">NOTE 4</span>: After reactivating a mouse, the mouse will actually be cageless - it will NOT be put back into its last cage. So you will need to find this mouse in your Mouse List and move it.</li>

				<ol>
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Pups will be hidden on loading of the Mouse List</span>: When the Mouse List first loads, only Stock, Mating and Wealing mice will be visible. If you want to find pups, you can easily open the Mouse Filter and search for them.

					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Weanlings will automatically change to Stock once mature</span>: Once weanling mice reach their Mature date, their "state" will automatically change to Stock. This will allow you to quickly distinguish between newly weaned mice (i.e. Weanlings) and mature non-mating adults (i.e. Stock mice). </li> 
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">More options added to the Preference menu regarding Page after login</span>: From your Preferences menu, you can now choose which List you want to see immediately after login. This provides more flexibility so that everytime you login into SoftMouse you can dive straight into your workflow.

				<ol>
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse List now sorts by Date of Birth</span>: In order to quickly locate mice, we have simplified the default sorting of the Mouse List so that the mice will list from oldest to youngest.</li> 
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating List now sorts by Set Up Date</span>: When first loading your Mating List, the records will now display with the oldest Mating Records at the top and the newest Mating Records at the bottom of the list. </li> 
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Breeder Table and Parent table now sort by Sex</span>: The mice showing in the Breeder Information table of the Edit Mating page and the Parent Information table of the Litter and Mouse Edit pages now sort by Sex, with males at the top and females at the bottom. </li>

	<span class="darkredfont bold">Fixed issues:</span>

	
				<ol>
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mouse Filter Owner parameter not reseting other fields when changed</span>: For group accounts, we have fixed an issue whereby switching the Owner in the Mouse Filter was not resetting the remaining fields after the Clear button was clicked on the Filter.</li>
					<li><span class="bold brightbluefont">Mating Filter clear button was falsely resetting the State to All matings</span>: We have fixed an issue whereby the Clear button in the Mating Filter was causing the State parameter to reset to ALL Matings instead of just the Active ones.</li>
